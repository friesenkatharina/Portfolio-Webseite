**Rock Paper Scissors Game with Java Script**
rock-paper-scissors game against the computer. \ When a user clicks on one of the elements (rock, paper, or scissors), the computer randomly selects an option, and the outcome is determined as either a win, loss, or tie for the user. \ The score is updated after each round, and the result is displayed along with a brief message. Visual feedback is provided by temporarily adding class effects to the user's choice, highlighting the selection with green for a win, red for a loss, and gray for a tie.

**Meal Generator**
When the element with the id "get_meal" is clicked, this code makes a request to TheMealDB API to fetch a random meal. Upon a successful request, it parses the received data and calls the displayMeal function, passing the first meal object from the returned array. The displayMeal function then updates the inner HTML of the element with the id "meal_display" to show the meal's name, an image of the meal, and the cooking instructions.

        My professional journey has been nothing short of a thrilling adventure. It all began with my career as a cosmetologist and wellness specialist, where I dedicated a remarkable decade of my life to the beauty and wellness industry. During this time, I honed my skills and nurtured a deep passion for providing relaxation and rejuvenation to individuals.

My path took an exciting turn when I found myself in Australia, working within hotel wellness facilities. It was here that my fascination with the tourism sector blossomed. This newfound interest motivated me to pursue further education, leading me to embark on a journey to become a certified Hotel Management professional. I approached this endeavor with dedication and enthusiasm, and my hard work paid off when I secured two prominent positions as a Front Office Manager.

However, life had other plans for me, and in 2022, I faced a health challenge that necessitated a change of course. It was a difficult decision, but I chose to reprogram my career path. I found myself venturing into the world of web development, a field that has always intrigued me.

As I delve into the intricacies of web development through my current apprenticeship, I am filled with hope and determination. My goal is to establish a successful career in this dynamic industry and continue to embrace the ever-evolving world of technology.

My professional journey has been a series of unexpected twists and turns, but each experience has shaped me into a versatile and resilient individual. I am excited about what the future holds as I continue to learn, grow, and adapt in pursuit of new horizons.
